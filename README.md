# PyWithPy

Using Py to calculate Pi

## What this is
This is a Python console application that calculates the number Pi. You can choose the number of iterations (The more, more precise it will be but will also take more time) and the preciseness of division. The division algorithm was fully recreated and divides using the way we humans do division by hand, so it does not round anything and the preciseness can be fully controlled to any decimal.

## Build from source

The code does not use any extra modules and can be built using whatever you want, PyInstaller is my preference. Prebuilt Windows binaries can be found in the releases section.
